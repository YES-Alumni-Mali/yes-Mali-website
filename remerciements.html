                As you have probably seen on the websites, placement organizations are those that help us during our exchange year in the US.
                 They are the link between our country and American host families. They find us local coordinators to help us better navigate our new environment, guide us, and give us all the resources we need. No matter the state, placement organizations have a huge impact on the success of our exchange year.
                 A big thank you to all the people working within those organizations.
