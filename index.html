                The Youth Exchange and Study program, or YES program, is a program funded by the U.S. Department of State.
                As its name suggests, the YES program gives youth leaders and talented individuals the opportunity to explore the United States, share their cultures, and help others understand them.
                The goal of this website is to help you understand the impact of this program through the lens of those who have participated in it.
